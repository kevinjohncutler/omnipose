some of these already solved 
// 1. the undo on double tap requires two undos to work, not one
// 2. affinity graph is back to making the ipad lag really, really slow. I think we fixed this before but I guess it got lost in a rollback. 
// 3. On magic trackpad, I think there is a force touch. we could use this to trigger a flood fill int he same way double tap does. 
// 4. save state on reload is broken again
