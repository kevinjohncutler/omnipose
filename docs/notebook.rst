:sinebow17:`In a notebook`
==========================

We have two thorough tutorials on using Omnipose in a Jupyter notebook. The first focuses on mono-channel segmentation of locally saved images.  
The second shows how to use a second channel to aid in segmentation, also taking the opportunity to demonstrate how to download images on-the-fly in a notebook.
