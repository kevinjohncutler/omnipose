# Omnipose
All scripts required to reproduce our data and figures in [Omnipose: a high-precision, morphology-independent solution for bacterial cell segmentation](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.03.467199) under `/omnipose/figures/`. Many algorithms required either a separate `conda` environment or a standalone application, so I opted to store our segmentation results for each algorithm in an appropriate directory to be read into the notebooks. These directories should be quite clear from thse scripts, but the top levels will need to be replaced according to your own folder structure. Namely, `/home/kcutler/DataDrive` on our Linux machine might be replaced by `/Volumes/<wherever>` on a macOS machine. Linux or Windows is recommended for Nvidia GPU support whenever evaluating DNN algorithms. Scripts, screenshots, and README files pertaining to the particulars of each tested algorithm are available in their respective subfolders.
